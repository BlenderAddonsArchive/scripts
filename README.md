Maskerade.py
==============

This is an addon that will hopefully make Rotoscoping and masking a bit easier.
If you install the addon you can press Ctrl+M on any compositor node with a Factor input (Such as Mix, RGB-Curves, etc.) and it will create a new mask node, connect it to the factor, create a new mask datablock and assign it to the masknode and any image or movielclip editor you might have open.
You can also double click on any mask node to activate that mask datablock in any image or clip editor you might have open in your current screen layout.
